1. Implementation of Exponential Series  in Cortex â€“M4. Use the standard exponential series. In this we express

e to the power of X as an infinite series

Refer to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt2dM0iiEeU

Produce the different values of e to power of x for various values to 0 to some high values. Extract the values

from the simulator in the form of a table. and plot them using excel or any other graph making tool like gnu plot, etc.

In the next  assignment we  will see how to use this implementation as a

Library that can be used for building   Machine Learning  programs on a ARM processor . 

Later you will learn how to write interface to this routine from high level language Like C



2. Implement tan(x) as a infinite series using the Tan series

Refer to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoAz-OqhqF0

Produce the different values of tan(x)  of x starting for zero to 360 degrees . Extract the values

from the simulator in the form of a table. and plot them using excel or any other graph making tool like gnu plot, etc. The objective is here you will experience Positive and negative infinities.
