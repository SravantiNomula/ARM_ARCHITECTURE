1. Implement Fibonacci  series using Cortex M4 (save as Q1_RollNo.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)
2. Given three number find the largest of the three using Cortex M4 (save as Q2_RollN.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)

3.  Given a number find out whether it is even or ODD in Cortex M4 (save as Q3_RollNo.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)

4. Can we do nested IF-Then else in CORTEX –M4?  (save as Q1_RollNo.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)

Try it out on your simulator ….

5.  On your Hardware board STMF32  find out how you can input a number either through a keyboard or through some kind of sensor and decide whether that is even or ODD  (save as Q5_RollNo.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)

6. Here is C program to find GCD of two numbers, Re-Write this for CORTEX –M4  (save as Q6_RollNo.s Example Q1_IMT2015517.s)

while (a != b)

 {

    if (a > b)

            a = a – b;

       else

            b = b – a;

}
